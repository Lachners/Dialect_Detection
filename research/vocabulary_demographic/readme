Relation between Demographic background and Vocabulary (vocab_demographic.ipynb):

-	The Notebook for this part of the work uses the preprocessed version of the Main Dataset extracted at the beginning (tweets_preprocessed.csv) for visualizing the the Word Occurrence and Mean Occurrence of expressions
  from an additional list of words within each category of background. A new list is then created and words that do not occur at all are not included in this new list.

-	Using this new list of words, by using the word embeddings from the BERT models trained previously and using additionally the Kmeans function by Sklearn to cluster the expressions together.
  Finally, the results of all this are plotted.

-	Using an additional list of grammatical features, the embeddings of these expressions are visualized through the same method as before
