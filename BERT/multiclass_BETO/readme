BETO Model for Multi-Class categorization (multi-class BERT.ipynb):
	
  -	Same as the previous two ones but trained through the text and background columns instead of the dialect labels by using the Reduced Dataset (subset_tweets_preprocessed.csv). 

  -	The outputs are saved in the “/multiclass_stuff” directory

  -  These outputs are later used for the word embeddings exposed in the research for Demographically related Vocabulary (found in demographic_vocab)
