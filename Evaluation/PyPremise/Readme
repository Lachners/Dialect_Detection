PyPremise (Pypremise.ipynb): 
	
  -	To run this notebook, it is necessary to provide the proper Dataset, already having Predictions and real Labels
  
  -	In this notebook we solely implemented the NE free predicted sets, due to them being less noisy and more interpretable

  -	PyPremise is a library that can be used for detecting patterns for the prediction outcomes provided.
    To get these patterns we use the predicted Datasets from evaluation (predicted_NO_NE_tweets_test_formal_preprocessed.csv, predicted_NO_NE_tweets_test_informal_preprocessed.csv) and count the matches (1)
    and mismatches (0) between predictions and real labels. We then save the tokenized words of each sentence in a list called features, while the PyPremise matching labels are saved in the Py_labels = [] list. 

  -	The outcome shows in which kind of features the model might show issues or perform specifically well.
